  <p><center>Hello everyone! I am currently a university student trying to improve my web development and coding skills! I am from the Bay Area, and I live
    with my 2 siblings and parents in Hayward, California. I enjoy reading, writing, baking, and spending time with my friends and family. My journey with classic
    literature started in middle school, where I was exposed to the works of Mark Twain and Mary Oliver. From there, I ventured to other authors and books. 
    If you would like to learn more about female authors who influenced classical literature, you're at the right page!</center></p>
